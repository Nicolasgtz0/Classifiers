### About Me
Multicultural student-athlete with extensive personal experience in diverse societies and environments (besides Pittsburgh, I have lived in Mexico City, Monterrey, NYC, Madrid, and Hong Kong). 6 month experience as a data analyst in the banking industry with projects involving machine learning algorithms, statistical modeling, and behavioral economics. Practical experience with real-life projects requiring financial planning and strategic business management. Great communication and people skills that allow me to act as a natural leader. I like to constantly challenge myself in every possible way and I certainly enjoy team working and getting the best out of everyone before trying to come up with a creative and effective solution.
